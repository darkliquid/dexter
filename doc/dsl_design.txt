I'm thinking of a structure along the lines of:

slide 'my first slide' do

  text 'some text to go on the slide'
  image 'image.jpg'
  
  event do
    text 'some more text'
  end
  
  event do
    text 'even more text'
  end
    
end

slide 'my second slide' do
  text 'you get the idea by now'
end
